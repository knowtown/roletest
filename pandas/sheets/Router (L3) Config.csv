2,,service nagle,,"! Enables the Nagle algorithm which says you can only have 1 unacknowledged oustanding TCP message. Basically if you have an unacknowledged TCP message, the device should keep buffering input from the user into the next TCP segment. This is useful especially in Telnet sessions, where input from the user is typically 1 character at a time typed into the console. This would result in 1-byte of data and the usual 40-byte TCP header, which results in 41-bytes being sent for 1-byte of actual useful data. So this algorithm instructs the sending device that as long as it has an outstanding unacknowledted TCP segment, keep buffering input from the user into the next TCP segment you're going to send. This avoids sending individual characters per TCP segment (1-byte of data with 40 bytes of header)",

Used for TCP and UDP code debugging as it is guaranteed to receive what is sent to it.), and ECHO (the receiver echos back an identical copy of the data it received.

6,,no service config,,"! Keeping the router from trying to load its configuration from over the network. The regular ""service config"" command is used when you want to implement remote configuration (i.e. have a router load a configuration file from a remote server), and it causes the router to first attempt to load a network file and then a host file. The router will try to load some generic file names by default from 255.255.255.255, so you have to also use ""boot"" commands to tell the router where to get the config file from. This ""service config"" option is disabled by default.

15,,no ip pim autorp listener,,"! AutoRP automates the distribution of group-to-rendezvous point (RP) mappings in a PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) network. To make AutoRP work, a device must be designated as an RP mapping agent, which receives the RP announcement messages from the RP's and arbitrates conflict. The RP mapping agent then sends the consistent group-to-RP mappings to all other devices by way of dense mode flooding. Using this dense mode flooding, all routers automatically discover which RP to use for the groups they support (AutoRP uses 224.0.1.39 and 224.0.1.40 , which have been assigned by the IANA). The ""ip pim autorp listener"" command causes IP multicast traffic for the two AutoRP groups 224.0.1.39 and 224.0.1.40 to be PIM dense mode flooded across interfaces operating in PIM sparse mode. This command is not needed when configuring sparse-dense mode (which we do on the Interfaces tab if multicast is required), so here we run the ""no ip pim autorp listener"" command to remove any AutoRP listener configuration.",

Note that although the buffer will contain many lines IOS allows only the recent entries to be shown with such as ""show log | begin Jun 10"". Remember to use two spaces for dates with one digit, e.g. Jun<sp><sp>9. Buffered logging uses the device's RAM to store log messages, instead of just displaying them on the console. The buffer of course has a fixed size, which you can configure. Old messages are deleted as new messages are added. Here, the buffer size (given in bytes) is 65536 bytes. The ""debugging"" argument is the name of the desired security level at which messages should be logged. Messages at or numerically lower then the specified level are logged. So debug messages are Level 7, so anything above Level 7 (Levels 1 - 6, which is basically everything) will get logged to the buffer.",60000?

Typically, logging messages (warnings, error and/or debugs etc.) are stored in a router's memory buffer (DRAM); when the buffer is full, older messages are overwritten by new messages. This poses an issue when trying to capture debugs for an intermittent issue, or during high traffic. Huge buffer size configuration can't always help as the buffer can get filled and overwritten quickly during verbose debugging. Using persistent logging allows IOS to write logged messages to file(s) on the router's flash disk. The advantage of this is that, unlike memory buffer (DRAM) contents, these files persist when the router reboots (DRAM contents are erased during a reboot.)",

40,,aaa new-model,,"! Sets the default login method to be AAA. NOTE THAT THIS COMMAND IS NEEDED TO ENABLE THE NEW ""TACACS SERVER"" STYLE COMMANDS BELOW. With just this line configured, local authentication is immediately applied to all lines and interfaces (except console line ""line con 0""). So, you would have to be authenticated using the local database of the router. (If doing this manually (not with this template), recommended to define a username and password on the device before running this command, and to save the configuration right before configuring AAA so that you can simply reload the device to recover from any lockouts.)

You will notice that if you look at the description of the ""aaa new-model"" command, it says that it enables ""NEW"" access control functions and disables ""OLD"" commands. What were the ""OLD"" commands then?

Well, instead of AAA, the ""old"" model has been called ""just Authentication, with little Authorization and no real Accounting"". ""Historically older methods of AAA have revolved around line level passwords and secrets. This leveraged user-set passwords on the various access points around the router to stop someone from directly logging onto the device and making changes."" So basically, you would set your password and/or username on the various lines/entry points on the router, which would provide Authentication, and you could set ""privilege"" levels for the users which gave a little Authorization. But remember this was all locally set on the router, not over the network.
When you run ""aaa new-model"", ""this will turn the [AAA] engine on and immediately overwrite/remove all line-level passwords and old methods of authentication. With this in mind, if you lose connection to this router at any stage, you will not be able to get back on as there will be no rules to govern the ""Auth"" part of the AAA, and the default is to allow NO access unless configured to allow ""no auth"". (a simple reboot will however return you to the old setup as the command requires the usual saves).""

So, when you run aaa new-model, you will notice that any ""login"" commands will be removed from the VTY lines (any ""password"" commands will remain but will now be ignored). The Console line config should remain the same. I have heard that there is a theory that originally Cisco wrote the ""aaa new-model"" code to also apply to the Console line, but too many people were getting locked out of their routers so they backed it off. Not sure if this is true or if Cisco originally intended to exclude the Console line from ""aaa new-model"".

Basically, without ""aaa new-model"" the default for authentication  (on console and vty) is to use the line password. But when you enable ""aaa new-model"" then the default for authentication becomes local (i.e. username/password).

Also, in terms of Authorization, bear in mind, ""when configuring ""aaa new-model"", authorization is NOT configured by default on newer IOS images. Therefore, when logging into a Cisco Router and/or Switch with a user account that has level 15 privileges, you will not automatically be placed into privileged (Exec) mode as you were in the older non-aaa ""login local"" Authentication method. To fix this, you'll need to add a AAA statement to specify console Authorization.""

This ""default"" list is applied everywhere by default when AAA is enabled (i.e. when you run ""aaa new-model"" above) and then defines a method for authentication. So basically this is a named ""list of authentication methods."" Here, we are saying the ""default"" behavior (i.e. the behavior of the ""default authentication list"") is to try TACACS+ first (""group tacacs+"", which means to use the list of all tacacs+ hosts that you've defined elsewhere in the config), and if no response (i.e. an error occurs), try the local router database, and if no response, try the line authentication method.

42,,aaa authentication login NO-TACACS line,,"! Setting up the Authentication part of AAA for users who want exec access into the device. The command defines a named authentication list (in this case we are creating a named list called ""NO-TACACS"") and then saying the authentication method for that method list (""NO-TACACS"") is line authentication. (Basically named method lists like ""NO-TACACS"" is just a way to group various combinations of authentication/authorization/accounting methods.) When you create a named method list, you are defining a particular list of methods for the indicated authentication/authorization/accounting type. Once a named list (e.g. ""NO-TACACS"") is created, it must be applied to a line or interface for it to come into effect (we will do this below on line console 0).",Use upper-case with dashes going forward for labels
43,,aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ if-authenticated ,,"! The ""aaa authorization exec"" command determines if the user is allowed to run an EXEC shell. Exec authorization is only carried out over vty and tty lines. Here, we're saying the ""default"" behavior (i.e. we're using the ""default"" named list which is applied everywhere by default) is that all users must be authenticated with TACACS+ for an EXEC shell. The ""if-authenticated"" part of the command is another authorization method (like group tacacs, local, group radius, etc.), which says that after the initial authentication, if the ""authorization"" piece fails between the device (router/switch) and the TACACS+ server, the device will go ahead and say the user is ""authorized"" because they were previously authenticated. Otherwise, without the ""if-authenticated"" authorization method, if the authentication was successful and the ""authorization"" part failed between the device and the TACACS+ server, the login as a whole would fail. Also note that the ""if-authenticated"" method is a terminating method (i.e. any authorization methods listed after it will never be evaluated). For authorization using TACACS+, the router/switch exchanges authorization information with the TACACS+ security daemon. TACACS+ authorization defines specific rights for users by associating attribute-value (AV) pairs, which are stored in a database on the TACACS+ security server, with the appropriate user. Also, see above for explanation on the ""group tacacs+"" keywords.

The info in the below NOTE is confirmed with AAA debug messages.
NOTE: The ""if-authenticated"" piece of the command does not give the user their stated privilege level in the ""username"" command above. So if you had configured something like ""username PLAYER1 privilege 15 secret CISCO"" , you would need to use the ""local"" keyword in the Authentication command so that the device will look in the local user database, where it would see your configured username and the associated Privilege level.
Without the ""local"" keyword, the ""if-authenticated"" part of the command simply allows the login to succeed but it does not make the device look at the local user store, which means no Privilege level is loaded for the user, so the device default to the lowest Privilege level, which is 0. So, you would start at the ""switch>"" prompt and have to run the ""enable"" command and enter the enable password to get into Enable mode (which the AAA/MEMORY process would run ""free_user"" on your privilege 0 user, removing it from memory, and then immediately run ""create_user"" on your same userid which creates a new ""user"" object in memory but this time with a new Privilege level of 15. Note that it seems like it doesn't matter what your configured Privilege level is as long as you know the Enable password.).

Another fun fact: when you are logging into the console, there is of course no username associated with that login. However, when you run the ""enable"" command via the console, the AAA/MEMORY process runs ""create_user"" and creates a user called ""NULL"" with Privilege level 15 in memory, and then once you enter the enable password, AAA/MEMORY runs ""free_user"" and removes that ""NULL"" user from memory, so you are again back to the ""blank"" user that you used when initially logging in via the console.",

This in turn results in a single modify event to the Cisco Express Forwarding plane. If the ""no ip routing protocol purge interface"" command is executed and a link goes down, the RIB process is automatically triggered to delete all prefixes that have the next hop on this interface from the RIB. The protocols on all the routers are notified, and if there is a secondary path, the protocols will update the RIB with the new path.

Path MTU Discovery is a method for maximizing the use of the available bandwidth in the network between endpoints of a TCP connection, which is described in RFC 1191. IP Path MTU Discovery allows a host to dynamically discover and cope with differences in the maximum allowable maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of the various links along the path. Sometimes a device is unable to forward a datagram because it requires fragmentation (the packet is larger than the MTU that you set for the interface with the interface configuration command), but the “do not fragment” (DF) bit is set. The intermediate gateway sends a “Fragmentation needed and DF bit set” Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message to the sending host, alerting the host to the problem. On receiving this message, the host reduces its assumed path MTU and consequently sends a smaller packet that will fit the smallest packet size of all links along the path.",

100,,no ip forward-protocol udp domain ,,"! Enabling a helper address or UDP flooding on an interface causes the Cisco IOS software to forward certain broadcast/service packets to the specified helper ip address. There are 2 ways you can configure an ip helper. First, you would need to specify an ip address that you want to relay the certain broadcast messages to. You would use the ""ip helper-address"" command for this. Now by default, this command not only specifies the helper IP address, but also specifies 8 default types of UDP broadcasts that it will relay to that helper IP address (Time (37), TACACS (49), DNS (53), BOOTP/DHCP Server (67), BOOTP/DHCP Client (68), TFTP (69), NetBIOS name service (137), NetBIOS datagram service (138) ). Now, if you didn't want certain of those UDP broadcasts to be relayed to the helper, you can use the ""ip forward-protocol"" command, which also forwards the default 8 but you can run the ""no"" version of the command to remove certain types of UDP broadcasts. Also, with this ""ip forward-protocol"" command you can specify to forward a UDP broadcast that isn't in the list of 8 that are forwarded via the ""ip helper-address"" command (essentially the ""ip forward-protocol"" command in IOS allows an administrator to forward any UDP port in addition to the default 8 (so you can specify exactly which types of broadcast packets you would like to have forwarded), AND you can also remove any of the default 8 UDP broadcasts from the list of UDP broadcasts sent to the helper). So, in our design, we want to disable 6 out of the 8 UDP protocols that are forwarded by default, and just leave the DHCP server and DHCP client UDP ports to be forwarded to the helper. This particular command disables forwarding of DNS broadcasts (port 53)",

Thankfully, Cisco provides support for ifindex values to persist across reboots. This ""snmp ifmib ifindex persist"" command enables ifindex persistence for all interfaces on a routing device by using the ifDescr and ifIndex entries in the ifIndex table of interface MIB (IF-MIB).

NTP clock-period is a value that the router or switch calculates as it keeps track of the time from the server to which it has synced.

The system automatically generates the ""ntp clock-period"" command as NTP determines the clock error and compensates. This is essentially a representation of the frequency of the crystal used as the local timebase, and may take several days to calculate otherwise. Basically, as NTP compensates for the error in the software clock, it keeps track of the correction factor for this error. When the value for the clock period needs to be adjusted, the system automatically enters the correct value into the running configuration (using the ""ntp clock-period [value]"" command). To remove the automatically generated value for the clock period, use the ""no ntp clock-period"" command, which will clear the current value (IOS will calculate a new value).
